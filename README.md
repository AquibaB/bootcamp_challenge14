## Tuning ML model:

### Step #1. Widening the training window from 3 months to 12 months

A larger training dataset spanning 12 months (as opposed to the original 3 months) resulted in slightly better accuracy (56% versus 55% original). 

The model's prediction of positive returns improved with perfect recall (100%) and 56% precision.

However, the model's prediction of negative return deteriorated and failed in making any predictions (recall and precision were 0)
